## Overview
This project was implemented using Vue CLI. I also used a mock [API] (https://my-json-server.typicode.com/mariacuadroszm/test-api/). I developed this challenge to put into practice my recently acquired Vue knowledge.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vue

### What I learned

I learned how to integrate an API with a Frontend project. I also practiced how to use Vue's router and how to emit events from a child component to its parent.
